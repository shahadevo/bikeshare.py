# Bikeshare Data Analysis üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Project Overview
This project explores bikeshare data for three major US cities: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC**.  
The goal is to provide insights about:
- Popular times of travel (month, day, hour).
- Popular stations and trips.
- Trip duration statistics.
- User information (user types, gender, birth years).

The project was built as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program to practice **Python, Pandas, and Git/GitHub workflows**.
